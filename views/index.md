Hi, I'm Sella, a senior web developer and architect.

I have 17 years of experience in software development and management as a backend/frontend developer, team lead, CTO, and [consultant](/consulting). 

I usually work with JavaScript (including Vanilla, jQuery, Vue, React, Angular1-2+, Node), Ruby (Rails, Sinatra) and Python (Django, Flask).

My previous experience includes 8200 (5 years), CS @ Hebrew University (*magna cum laude*), Fiverr (2 years), and CTO of a social network, [yes.no](https://medium.com/@sellarafaeli/yes-no-architecture-of-a-social-network-startup-in-2016-d6d2989ca1b3) (10 employees). <!-- For the last couple of years I have been the web architect at [Hysolate](https://www.hysolate.com/). -->
