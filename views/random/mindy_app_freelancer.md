# mindy app freelancer

2019-10-06

Hey there. I am looking for a freelancer to help me build a very basic mobile app, written in React Native (for both mobile platforms)

The app is a mobile app for [https://usemindy.com](https://usemindy.com). **mindy** is a tiny [web] app that I have built, which helps send 'mindfulness' messages to remind people that everything is ok, and that they can take life easy. This app is meant for people like myself, who suffer from bad moods and anxieties, so that they can suffer just a bit less. The app is currently free - you can try it for yourself. 

The app currently sends SMS text messages. Sadly, that costs money. **mindy** is already at a scale where I cannot sustain sending more text messages. I would prefer to keep the app free, for now, so I need a way to send push notifications for free. This is why I need a mobile app. 

For this reason, the app is to be very simple. From a functionality POV, it needs at this point to have a login screen, and a "settings" screen. Both of these can be webviews, for which I will supply the web code. 

Naturally, the app needs to be sent to the stores, download-able, and support push notifications. These are obvious for any app, but I personally would need your help to integrate and take this thing end to end to a point where a user can download it, login, configure settings, and receive push notifications. I will also need to be able to administer minor changes to the app, if one day necessary. This is why the app is to be in React Native (and also because RN is just a good idea in general for an app like this). 

I will be supplying the backend as well as any necessary webview FE. 

If you would like to collaborate on this app, that would be great. Not everything in life is money, and this app already helps many people (for free). As a freelancer myself, however, I am aware that future karma is not always the best coin. I am thus happy to provide the appropriate cash compensation for expedient desired results. 

For any questions, please contact me at **sella dot rafaeli at gmail dot com**. 

Cheers, and take it easy. Everything is ok. :)
