I believe in Now. 

Do things now. When choosing what to do right now - choose to do what you want to do. When choosing what to think, choose to think about right now. 

We are programmed to plan for later. We are very good at, both as a species and as individuals. If you are reading this text, you are likely amongst the best at it. Evolution has given humans a large prefrontal cortex which leads us be able to make long-term plans. This is optimal for survival; planning for the long-term wins against those who cannot plan long-term. 

However, these abilities come with a price. We are biologically selected for and incentivized to mentally be focused on the future. This trend is manifested through societal pressure to invest in one's career and offspring; manifested through formal education and expectations of a life constantly defined by the future one is working towards. Any one who is focused on the future, is not focused on the present moment; is not fully enjoying themself, is not living life to the fullest. Planning for the future versus being present in the moment is the difference between an entire life of planning for later, and an entire life of living for now. For if you cannot focus on the moment now, you will not be able to focus on the moment later. 

To quote Alan Watts: 

<blockquote>If I am so busy planning how to eat next week that I cannot fully enjoy what I am eating now, I will be in the same predicament when next week's meals become "now."
</blockquote>

One way to cultivate being in the present moment is being spontaneous. Do not make plans; do not plan for the future. Instead, cultivate the practice of listening to your own thoughts, needs and wants; of paying attention attentively to your immediate surroundings and environment. 

Do not make a plan and follow it; follow whatever is happening with no plan. 

The more you can live focused on the present and not on the future, the more you will be living in the moment.

Happy travels, choose your way. :)
